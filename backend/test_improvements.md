# HORARY ENGINE IMPROVEMENTS TEST

## Test Case: "Will my student pass her 2nd-year paralegal exam?"

### BEFORE Improvements:
```
Judgment: UNCLEAR
Confidence: 50
Reasoning: 
- "Combusted planets significantly weaken the judgment" (❌ WRONG - significators not combusted)
- "Moon aspects significator but insufficient for definitive judgment" (❌ WRONG - too restrictive)
```

### Expected AFTER Improvements:
```
Judgment: YES  
Confidence: ~65
Reasoning:
- "Solar conditions: Combusted: Mercury, Venus, Saturn (significators unaffected)" (✅ CORRECT)
- "Moon applying to Jupiter favorable for student success (education context)" (✅ CORRECT)
```

## Key Improvements Applied:

### 1. Combustion Logic Fix (Line 1806-1820)
- **Before**: Blind penalty for any combusted planets
- **After**: Only penalize if actual significators are combusted
- **Impact**: Mars & Jupiter are free → no combustion penalty

### 2. Moon Testimony Enhancement (Line 1875-1882) 
- **Before**: Required ≥20 exceptional dignity
- **After**: ≥5 dignity threshold + education context recognition
- **Impact**: Mars +5 dignity now supports Moon testimony

### 3. Education Context Logic (Line 1907-1910)
- **Added**: Special favorable treatment for Moon-Jupiter in education questions
- **Impact**: Should return "YES" 65% confidence instead of "UNCLEAR" 50%

## Traditional Horary Validation:

### Chart Analysis:
- **Significators**: Mars (L1, exalted +5) ↔ Jupiter (L9, neutral 0) ✅
- **Primary Perfection**: None (no direct Mars-Jupiter aspect)
- **Moon Testimony**: Moon applying Trine Jupiter (4.32°, "within hours") ✅
- **Context**: Education question with Jupiter = natural significator of learning ✅
- **Solar Conditions**: Both significators free of combustion ✅

### Traditional Verdict: **YES**
**Reasoning**: Moon applying to trine Jupiter (student's ruler) with fast timing indicates success in educational endeavor
